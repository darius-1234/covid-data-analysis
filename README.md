# covid-data-analysis

This was a project I conducted over the first COVID-19 lockdown. I found an extensive COVID-19 dataset and used Python to discover and visualise interesting domestic and international trends. I have commented on and evaluated my findings throughout the Covid Project ipynb file itself. 
To display graphs clearly, I hosted a file (CovidWeb.ipynb) on AWS and was able to render a graph on a webpage, and update it by editing the file.
