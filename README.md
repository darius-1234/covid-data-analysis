# covid-data-analysis

This was a project I conducted over the first COVID-19 lockdown. I found an extensive COVID-19 dataset and used Python to discover and visualise interesting domestic and international trends. I have commented on and evaluated my findings throughout covid_main.ipynb, which uses functions from covid_data_manipulation.ipynb to transform and create new Pandas DataFrames and functions from covid_graphs.ipynb to plot different a variety of non-interactive and interactive graphs. To display graphs clearly, I hosted a file (CovidWeb.ipynb) on a server using AWS and was able to render a graph on a webpage, updating it by editing the corresponding Jupyter Notebook.
